# Crop Prediction using Machine Learning
The **Crop Prediction** project leverages machine learning techniques to recommend suitable crops for farmers based on soil and weather conditions. This initiative aims to enhance agricultural productivity, minimize soil degradation, and improve farmers' profitability by integrating advanced technology into farming practices.

## üöÄ Features and Modules
- **Crop Recommendation:** Identifies the most suitable crop based on soil properties, pH, temperature, and weather conditions.
- **Fertilizer Guidance:** Suggests the optimal type and quantity of fertilizers for specific crops.
- **New Crop Cultivation:** Encourages farmers to diversify by exploring new crop varieties.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements multiple algorithms to achieve high prediction accuracy.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves above 95% accuracy for crop prediction across all tested crops.

## üéØ Objective
To provide farmers with a robust decision-making tool by:
- Predicting the most profitable and suitable crops based on environmental and soil parameters.
- Enhancing crop yield and promoting sustainable farming practices.
